I
uncover
insights.


*Practical, meaningful insights.*


My work is my passion.

*My passion is my work.*

In my experience in e-Commerce data analytics, there has been an explosion in the amount of available data and tools to analyze and improve the way we run our e-Commerce businesses. But what I've noticed is that the amount of *people* who understand how and can deliver the simple-yet-valuable insights has not.  So I've set out to solve for this crucial part of the equation and most importantly, *teach others how to do the same.*
