# About Harbor Island Analytics

Hello, my name is Justin and I am the founder of Harbor Island Analytics.

Harbor Island Analytics is focused on helping e-commerce operators more profitably leverage the behavioral data of their customers.

I believe that the better we are at using and understanding our data the better we are at maintaining longer lasting relationships with our customers and growing our businesses.

I founded Harbor Island Analytics because I am passionate about discovering new insights hidden within data.  Our focus is simple: finding our clients valuable insights from their business’s website data.

The amount of data available to businesses is overwhelming and as a result, decisions are still made based on intuition rather than fact (aka – statistically valid conclusions drawn from data).  The reasons behind this are simple: most companies face the problem of not enough available human resources, knowledge or time to spend.

If you’re interested in having just a conversation or would like to explore the possiblity of working together, [contact us today](http://harborislandanalytics.com/contact/) and let’s start by having us perform a Site Review of your Google Analytics data.
